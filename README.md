# Understanding the affectance of Taiwan real-time events in Twitter
WebIntelligence final project in collaboration with Pau Nonell. Data obtained directly from both Twitter and Youtube apis. 

In the context of Web Inteligence final project, both me and Pau were really interested in understand the affectance that real-events could have in social network user behaviors. Having both of us lived in Taiwan and considering both Taiwan is a geopolitical hot location and the huge amount of users that the island presents, Taiwan was chosen as the main topic of the project. 

Taiwan is considered as a geopolitica hot spot as it presents a de-facto independent status, but its not accepted as an independent country worldwide. This has leaded this little island of the southeast Asia region to such a paradoxical scenario: It is not considered as an independent country on its own (only 11 minor countries worldwide recognize it as an independent country), however, it presents a total independence from china (economically, politically and socially). 
  * This has made us wonder what can we obtain from social networks regarding this political conflict. 
  * Some extra studies will be performed to see how real-life events influence social networks and correlate with its users behavior.
 
To understand this behavior, some libraries have been used to detect the positivity of tweets and the polarity of the sentiments associated to them. Some interesting conclusions came out as outputs of this project: 
 
*  The social media analysis have confirmed that Taiwan reactions are highly related with China and their political conflict. But we also have seen a lot of interactions with other successes such as with the Myanmar political situation.
*  Real Time-events have immediate consequences and influences on social networks. This has been observed in the different political events that have had inmediat repercussion on twitter.
*  Random events such as earthquakes or the pinapple ban can be monitorized using social networks as well.
*  Knowing that a certain topic has suddnely increased its presence on social networks, might mean something related to it has happened, and one can obtain worthy information from it observing the interaction of the users with the event.
*  From the Youtube analysis we can conclude that the more subjective a comment is, the more polarized it is as well.
